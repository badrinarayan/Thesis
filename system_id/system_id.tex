\chapter{System Identification}
\label{chap:sysid}

Identifying dynamical systems from noisy observation of their input-output
behavior is of fundamental importance in systems and control theory. Often times
models derived from physical first principles are not available to the control
engineering, and computing a surrogate model from data is essential to the
design of a control system. System identification from data is thus ubiquitous
in problem domains ranging from process engineering, dynamic modeling of
mechanical and aerospace systems, and systems biology. Though there are a myriad
of approaches and excellent texts on the subject (see, for
example~\cite{LjungBook}), there is still no universally agreed upon approach
for this problem. One reason is that quantifying the interplay between system
parameters, measurement noise, and model mismatch tends to be challenging.

This chapter draws novel connections between contemporary high-dimensional
statistics, operator theory, and linear systems theory to prove consistent
estimators of linear systems from small measurement sets. In particular,
building on recent studies of \emph{atomic norms} in estimation
theory~\cite{crpw,btr12}, I propose a penalty function which encourages
estimated models to have small McMillan degree.

A related family of system identification techniques use finite sample Hankel
matrices to estimate dynamical system models, using either singular value
decompositions (e.g,~\cite{Verhaegen92,Overschee94}) or semidefinite
programming~\cite{Fazel01,Liu08,Smith12,Fazel11}. In all of these techniques,
no statistical guarantees were given about the quality of estimation with
finite noisy data, and it was difficult to determine how sensitive these
methods were to the hidden system parameters or measurement noise. Moreover,
since these problems were dealing with finite, truncated Hankel matrices, it is
never certain if the size of the Hankel matrix is sufficient to reveal the true
McMillan degree. Moreover, the techniques based on semidefinite programming are
challenging to scale to very large problems, as their complexity grows
superlinearly with the number of measurements.

In contrast, the atomic norm regularizer proposed in this chapter is not only
equivalent to the sum of the Hankel singular values (the Hankel nuclear norm),
but is also well approximated by a finite dimensional, $\ell_1$ minimization
problem. I show that solving least-squares problems regularized by atomic
norm is consistent, and scales gracefully with the stability radius, the
McMillan degree of the system to be identified, and the number of measurements.
Numerical experiments validate these theoretical underpinnings, and show
that this method has great promise to provide concrete estimates on the hard
limits of estimating linear systems.

\subsection*{Notation}\label{sec:notation}

We will adopt standard notation; $\D$ and $\bbS$ will denote respectively the
open unit ball and the unit circle in the complex plane $\C$ . $\cH_2$ and
$\cH_\infty$ will denote the Hardy spaces of functions analytic outside $\D$,
with the norms

\[\|f\|_{\cH_2} = \tfrac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} |f(e^{i\theta})|^2 d\theta~~~~~\mbox{and}~~~~~\|f\|_{\cH_\infty} = \sup_{z\in\bbS} |f(z)|\]
respectively.  $\ell_2([a,b])$ will denote the set of square summable sequences on the integers in $[a, b]$.

\section{Atomic Decompositions of Transfer Functions}\label{sec:atomic-def}
In this chapter, we will concern ourselves with Single Input Single Output
(SISO) systems. Suppose we wish to estimate a SISO, LTI system with transfer
function $G_\star(z)$ from a finite collection of measurements
$y=\Phi(G_\star)$. The set of all transfer functions is an infinite dimensional
space, so reconstructing $G_\star$ from this data is ill-posed. In order to make
it well posed, a common regularization approach constructs a penalty function
$\operatorname{pen}(\cdot)$ that encourages ``low-complexity'' models and solves
the optimization problem
\begin{equation}\label{eq:regularized}
	\minimize_G~\|\Phi(G)-y\|_2^2 + \mu \operatorname{pen}(G) \,.
\end{equation}
This formulation uses the parameter $\mu$ to balance between model complexity
and fidelity to the data. The least-squares cost can be modified to other convex
loss functions if knowledge about measurement noise is available (as
in~\cite{Smith12,Paganini96}), though in general it is less clear how to design
a good penalty function.

In many applications, we know that the true model can be decomposed as a linear
combination of very simple building blocks. For instance, as described in
Chapter~\ref{chap:ast}, sparse vectors can be written as short linear
combinations of vectors from some discrete dictionary and low-rank matrices can
be written as a sum of a few rank-one factors. Here, let us recall some of the
preliminaries from Chapter~\ref{chap:ast}. In~\cite{crpw}, Chandrasekaran et al.
proposed a universal heuristic for constructing regularizers based on such prior
information. If we assumed that
\[
	G_\star = \sum_{i=1}^r c_i a_i\,,~\mbox{for some}~a_i\in\cA,c_i\in \C\,,
\]
where $\cA$ is an origin-symmetric set of atoms normalized to have unit norm and
$r$ is relatively small, then the appropriate penalty function is the atomic
norm induced by the atomic set $\cA$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:atomic-norm-def}
\begin{split}
	\|G\|_{\cA}: & = \inf\left\{ t \; : \; G \in t\text{ conv}(\cA)  \right\}  =\inf\left\{ \sum_{a\in \cA} |c_a|~:~G = \sum_{a\in \cA} c_a a\right\}\,.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
In~\cite{crpw}, it is shown that minimizing the atomic norm subject to
compressed measurements yielded the tightest known bounds for recovering many
classes of models from linear measurements. Moreover, in Chapter~\ref{chap:ast},
we saw the atomic norm regularizer in the context of denoising problems and
saw that it produces consistent estimates at nearly optimal estimation error
rates for many classes of atoms.

Corresponding to the atomic norm, there is a dual atomic norm.  For an atomic set $\cA$, the dual norm is given by
\[
	\| z \|_{\cA}^* = \sup_{a \in \cA} \langle a, z \rangle\,.
\] 
Note that for this norm, we have the generalization of H\"{o}lder's inequality $\langle x,z\rangle \leq \|x\|_{\cA}\|z\|_{\cA}^*$.  Moreover, note that
\[
	 \alpha \|x\|_{\cA'} \leq \|x\|_{\cA} \leq \beta\|x\|_{\cA'}
\]
for some $\alpha\leq 1$ and $\beta\geq 1$ for all $x$ if and only if
\[
	 \beta^{-1} \|z\|_{\cA'}^* \leq \|z\|_{\cA}^* \leq \alpha^{-1}\|z\|_{\cA'}^*
\]
for all $z$. For more details, see Chapter~\ref{chap:ast}

To apply these atomic norm techniques to system identification, we must first
determine the appropriate set of atoms. For discrete time LTI systems with small
McMillan degree, we can always decompose any finite dimensional, strictly proper
system $G(z)$ as:
$$
G(z)=\sum_{i=1}^{s} \frac{c_i}{z-a_i}\,.
$$
via a partial fraction expansion. Hence, it makes sense that our set of atoms
should be single-pole transfer functions. So, define the atomic set for linear
systems by
\[
\cA = \left\{ \varphi_{w}(z) = \frac{1-|w|^2}{z-w} ~:~w\in \D\right\}\,.
\]
The numerator is normalized so that the Hankel norm of each atom is $1$. See the
discussion in Section~\ref{sec:hankel} for precisely why this normalization is
desirable.

The atomic norm penalty function associated with these atoms is 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:atomic-def}
	\| G(z) \|_{\cA} = \inf \left\{ \sum_{w\in \D} |c_w| ~:~ G(z) = \sum_{w\in\D} \frac{c_w (1-|w|^2)}{z-w}\right\}\,,
\end{equation}
where the summation implies that only a countable number of terms have nonzero
coefficients $c_w$. This expression finds the decomposition of $G(z)$ into a
linear combination of single pole systems such that the $\ell_1$ norm, weighted
by the norms of the single poles, is as small as possible.

With this penalty function in hand, we can now turn to analyzing its utility. In
Section~\ref{sec:hankel}, I will first show that for most systems of interest
$\|G\|_{\cA}$ is a well-defined, bounded quantity. Moreover, we will see that
the atomic norm is equivalent to the nuclear norm of the Hankel operator
associated with $G$. Hence, the models that are preferred by our penalty
function will have low-rank Hankel operators, and thus low McMillan degrees.

Section~\ref{sec:computation} describes practical algorithms for approximating
atomic norm regularization problems for several classes of measurements. We will
show that with finite data, our atomic norm minimization problem is
well-approximated by a finite-dimensional $\ell_1$ norm regularization problem.
In particular, using specialized algorithms adapted to the solution of the
LASSO~\cite{wright09}, we can solve atomic norm regularization problems in time
competitive with respect to techniques that regularize with the nuclear norm and
SVD-based subspace identification methods. We will leave the actual analysis of
the approximation by discretization to Chapter~\ref{chap:algos} on algorithms.

Finally, Section~\ref{sec:statistics} analyzes the statistical performance of
atomic norm minimization and shows that the proposed algorithm is asymptotically
consistent over several measurement ensembles of interest. We will focus on
sampling the transfer function on the unit circle and present $\cH_2$ error
bounds in terms of the stability radius, Hankel singular values, $\cH_{\infty}$
norm, and McMillan degree of the system to be estimated.

\section{The Hankel Nuclear Norm and Atomic Norm Minimization}\label{sec:hankel}

Let us first show that most LTI systems of interest do indeed have finite atomic
norm, and, moreover, that the atomic norm is closely connected with the sum of
the Hankel singular values.

\subsection{Preliminaries: the Hankel operator}\label{sec:hankel-defs}
Recall that the \emph{Hankel operator}, $\Gamma_G$, of the transfer function $G$
is defined as the mapping from the past to the future under the transfer
function $G$. Given a signal $u$ supported on $(-\infty,-1]$, the output under
$G$ is given by $g * u$ where ``$*$'' denotes convolution and $g$ is the impulse
response of $G$:
\[
	G(z) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty g_k z^{-k}\,.
\]
$\Gamma_G$ is then simply the projection of $g*u$ onto $[0,\infty)$. An
introduction to Hankel operators in control theory can be found in~\cite[Chapter
4]{DullerudPaganiniBook} or~\cite[Chapter 7]{Zhou95}.

The \emph{Hankel norm} of $G$ is the operator norm of $\Gamma_G$ considered as
an operator mapping $\ell_2(-\infty,-1]$ to $\ell_2[0,\infty)$. The \emph{Hankel
nuclear norm} of $G$ is the nuclear norm (aka the trace norm or Schatten
$1$-norm) of $\Gamma_G$. To be precise, an operator $T$ is in the \emph{trace
class} $S_1$ if the trace of $(T^*T)^{1/2}$ is finite. This implies first that
$T$ is a compact operator and admits a singular value decomposition
\begin{equation*}
    T(f) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \sigma_i \langle v_i, f \rangle u_i \,.
\end{equation*}
The sequence $\sigma_i$ are called the \emph{Hankel singular values} of $T$.
Moreover, the Schatten $1$-norm of $T$ is given by
\begin{equation*}
    \|T\|_1 = \trace\left((T^*T)^{1/2}\right) =
    \sum_{i=1}^\infty \sigma_i\,.
\end{equation*}

\subsection{The atomic norm is equivalent to the Hankel nuclear norm}
\label{sub:equivalence-hankel-atomic}
The rank of the Hankel operator determines the McMillan degree of the linear
system defined by $G$. Rank minimization is notoriously computationally
challenging (see~\cite{Recht10} for a discussion), and we don't expect to be
able to directly penalize the norm of the Hankel operator in implementations.
Thus, as is common, a reasonable heuristic for minimizing the rank of the Hankel
operator would be to minimize the sum of the Hankel singular values, i.e., to
minimize the Schatten $1$-norm of the Hankel operator. For rational transfer
functions, we can compute the Hankel nuclear norm via a balanced
realization~\cite{Zhou95}. On the other hand, while the maximal Hankel singular
value can be written variationally as an LMI, we are not aware of any such
semidefinite programming formulations for the Hankel nuclear norm.

The following theorem provides a path towards minimizing the Hankel nuclear norm, minimizing the atomic norm $\|G(z)\|_{\cA}$ as a proxy.  Indeed, from the view of Banach space theory, the atomic norm is~\emph{equivalent} to the Hankel nuclear norm.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:hankel-nuclearity}
Let $G \in \cH_2$.  Then $\Gamma_G$ is trace class if and only if there exists a sequence $\{\lambda_k\} \in \ell_1$ and a
    sequence $\{w_k\}$ with $w_k \in \D$ such that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:kernel-form}
    g(z) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \lambda_k \frac{1-|w_k|^2}{z-w_k}\,.
    \end{equation}
Moreover, we have the following chain of inequalities
\begin{equation}\label{eq:norm-ineq-chain}
\tfrac{\pi}{8}\|G\|_{\cA} \leq  \|\Gamma_G\|_1 \leq
\|G\|_{\cA} 
\end{equation}
where  $\|G\|_{\cA}$ is given by~\eq{atomic-norm-def}.
\end{theorem}
\emph{Proof Outline}  Theorem~\ref{thm:hankel-nuclearity} follows by carefully combining several different results from operator theory. Peller first showed that transfer functions with trace class Hankel operators formed a \emph{Besov space}~\cite{Peller79}. Peller's argument can be found in his book~\cite{PellerHankelBook}. The atomic decomposition of such operators is due to Coifman and Rochberg~\cite{Coifman80}. The norm bounds~\eq{norm-ineq-chain} were proven by Bonsall and Walsh~\cite{Bonsall86}. There they show that the $\tfrac{\pi}{8}$ is the best possible lower bound.  They also show that if $\|\Gamma_g\|_1\leq C\|g\|_{\cA}$ for all $g$, then $C$ must be at least $\tfrac{1}{2}$, so the chain of inequalities is nearly optimal. A concise presentation of the full argument can be found  in~\cite{PartingtonHankelBook}. A modern perspective using the theory of reproducing kernels can be found in~\cite{ZhuBook}. 
\vspace{1mm}

\noindent Theorem~\ref{thm:hankel-nuclearity} asserts that a transfer function has a finite atomic norm if and only if the sum of its Hankel singular values is finite.  In particular, this means that every rational transfer function has a finite atomic norm.  More importantly, the atomic norm is equivalent to the Hankel nuclear norm.  Thus if we can approximately solve atomic norm-minimization, we can approximately solve Hankel nuclear norm minimization and vice-versa.

\subsection{System Identification using Atomic Norms}\label{sec:computation}

From here on, let us assume that the $G_\star$ that we seek to estimate has all
of its poles of magnitude at most $\rho$ ( we will call $\rho$ the
\emph{stability radius}, and treat it as a known parameter). Let $\D_\rho$
denote the set of all complex numbers with norm at most $\rho$. Note that if
$G_\star$ has stability radius $\rho$ then
\[
	\|G\|_{\cA}:=\inf\left\{ \sum_{w\in \D_\rho} |c_w|~:~G(z) = \sum_{w\in \D_\rho} \frac{c_w (1-|w|^2)}{z-w}\right\}\,.
\]
That is, we can restrict the set of atoms to only be those single pole systems with stability radius equal to $\rho$.  For the remainder of this manuscript,  assume that $\cA$ only consists of such single pole systems.

In what follows, let us focus on linear measurement maps.  Let $\cL_i: \cH \mapsto \C $ be a linear functional that serves as a measurement operator for the system $G(z)$.  Many maps of interest can be phrased as linear functionals of the transfer function,
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Samples of the frequency response $\mathcal{L}_k(G):=G(e^{i\theta_k})$ for $k=1,\ldots, n$.  From a control theoretic perspective, this measurement operator corresponds to measuring the gain and phase of the linear system at different frequencies.
	\item Samples of the impulse response, $\mathcal{L}_k(G):=g_{i_k}$ for $k=1,\ldots, n$ and $i_k \in [1,\infty)$.
	\item Convolutions of the impulse response with a pseudorandom signal $u_k$: $\mathcal{L}_k(G):=\sum_{j=1}^{\infty} g_j u_{k-j}$.
\end{enumerate}

In all of these cases, consider the problem
\begin{equation}\label{eq:atomic-norm-lin-inverse}
	\minimize_{G} \tfrac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^n |\cL_i(G) - y_i |^2 + \mu \|G\|_{\cA}\,.
\end{equation}
This problem is equivalent to the constrained, semi-infinite programming problem
\[
	\begin{array}{ll}
	\minimize_{x,G} & \tfrac{1}{2}\sum_{k=1}^n |x_k - y_k |^2 + \mu \sum_{w\in \D_\rho} |c_w|\\
	\st & x_k = \cL_k(G)~~\mbox{for}~i=1,\ldots, n\\
	& G = \sum_{w\in \D_\rho} \frac{c_w(1-|w|^2)}{z-w}
	\end{array}
\]
Eliminating the equality constraint gives yet another equivalent formulation
\begin{equation}\label{eq:atomic-norm-lin-inverse-finite-dim}
	\begin{array}{ll}
	\minimize_{x} & \tfrac{1}{2}\sum_{k=1}^n |x_k - y_k |^2 + \mu \sum_{w\in \D_\rho} |c_w|\\
	\st & x_k = \sum_{w\in \D_\rho} c_w \cL_k\left(\frac{1-|w|^2}{z-w}\right)~~\mbox{for}~i=1,\ldots, n\,.
	\end{array}
\end{equation}
Note that in this final formulation, our decision variable is $x$, a finite dimensional vector, and $c_w$, the coefficients of the atomic decomposition.  The infinite dimensional variable $G$ has been eliminated.  Let us define a norm on $\R^n$ based on the formulation~\eq{atomic-norm-lin-inverse-finite-dim}
\[
	\|x\|_{\cL(\cA)} = \inf \left\{ \sum_{w\in \D_\rho} |c_w| ~:~ x_i = \sum_{w\in\D_\rho} c_w\mathcal{L}_i\left(\frac{1-|w|^2}{z-w} \right)\right\}\,.
\]
Then we see that problem~\eq{atomic-norm-lin-inverse} is equivalent to the denoising problem
\begin{equation}\label{eq:finite-dim-ast}
	\minimize_{x} \tfrac{1}{2}\|x-y\|_2^2 + \mu \|x\|_{\cL(\cA)}\,.
\end{equation}
Note that the first term is simply the squared Euclidean distance between $y$
and $x$ in $\R^n$. The second term is an atomic norm on $\R^n$ induced by the
linear map of the set of transfer functions via the measurement operator $\cL$.

In order to tractably solve~\eq{atomic-norm-lin-inverse}, we will need
computational schemes for approximating $\|x\|_{\cL(\cA)}$. Such computational
considerations are treated in Chapter~\ref{chap:algos}. In that chapter, I show
that a sufficiently fine discretization of the unit disk can yield a good
approximation for the solution. In particular, we will need the following
proposition proved in Chapter~\ref{chap:algos}.

\begin{prop}\label{prop:grid}
Let $\D_\rho^{(\epsilon)}$ be a finite subset of the unit disc such that for any $w \in \D_\rho$ there exists a $v \in \D_\rho^{(\epsilon)}$ satisfying $|w-v| \leq \epsilon$.  Define
\[
	\|x\|_{\cL(\cA_\epsilon)} = \inf\left\{ \sum_{w\in \D_{\rho}^{(\epsilon)}} |c_w| ~:~ x_i = \sum_{w\in\D_{\rho}^{(\epsilon)}} c_w\mathcal{L}_i\left(\frac{1-|w|^2}{z-w} \right)\right\}\,.
\]
Then there exists a constant $C_\epsilon \in [0,1]$ such that
\[
	C_\epsilon \|x\|_{\cL(\cA_{\epsilon})} \leq \|x\|_{\cL(\cA)} \leq \|x\|_{\cL(\cA_{\epsilon})} \,.
\]
\end{prop}
\noindent The set $\D_\rho^{(\epsilon)}$ is called an $\epsilon$-net for the set
$\D_\rho$. We show in chapter~\ref{chap:algos} that when $\mathcal{L}_k(G) =
G(e^{i\theta_k})$, $C_{\epsilon}$ is at least $(1-\tfrac{16 \rho
\epsilon}{\pi(1-\rho)})$. Other measurement ensembles can be treated similarly.
Chapter~\ref{chap:algos} gives a way to solve \eqref{eq:finite-dim-ast}
approximately.

\section{Statistical Bounds}\label{sec:statistics}
Let $\cL_i: \cH \mapsto \C $ be a linear functional that serves as a measurement
operator for the system $H(z)$. In this section, let us suppose that we obtain
noisy measurements of the form
$$
y_i=\cL_i \left( H(z) \right) +\omega_i \qquad i=1, \ldots, n.
$$
where $\omega_i$ is a noise sequence consisting of independent, identically
distributed random variables. In this section, we will specialize our results to
the case where $\cL$ returns samples from the frequency response at uniformly
spaced frequencies:
$$
\cL_k(H(z))=H(z_k), \qquad z_k=e^{\frac{2 \pi i k}{m} }, \; k=1, \ldots, n.
$$
% While the techniques here extend to other measurement ensembles, they will be
% explored in a longer version of the paper.
%
%
%We only prove one theorem to illustrate the techniques required to analyze a general set of measurements.  The theorem will change with different grindings of the disk, measurements, and noise models.  We will study other examples in future work.

Our goal in this section is to prove that solving the DAST optimization problem
yields a good approximation to the transfer function we are probing. The
following theorem provides a precise statistical guarantee on the performance of
our algorithm.

Before going to the proof, let us recall the optimality conditions of atomic
soft thresholding proved in Chapter~\ref{chap:ast}, reproduced here for
convenience:
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:badri}
Let $\mathcal{Q}\subset \R^n$ be an arbitrary set of atoms.  Suppose that we observe $y = x_\star+\omega$ where $\omega\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2 I)$.  Let $\hat{x}$ denote the optimal solution of
\[
	\minimize_x \tfrac{1}{2}\|x-y\|_2^2 + \mu \|x\|_\mathcal{Q}
\]
with  $\mu \geq\|\omega\|_{\mathcal{Q}}^*$.  Then we have
\begin{align}
	 \|\hat{x}-x_\star\|_2^2 &\leq 2 \mu \|x_\star\|_{\mathcal{Q}}\\
	 \|\hat{x}\|_{\mathcal{Q}} &\leq \|x_\star\|_{\mathcal{Q}} + \mu^{-1} \langle \omega, \hat{x}-x_\star\rangle\,.
\end{align}
\end{theorem}
We will use these inequalities in the proof of the main theorem.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:estimation}  Let $G_\star$ be a strictly proper transfer function with bounded Hankel nuclear norm. Suppose the noise sequence $\omega_i$ is i.i.d. Gaussian with mean zero and variance $\sigma^2$.  Choose $\delta \in (0,1)$ and set $\epsilon = \frac{\pi (1-\rho)\delta}{16 \rho}$.  Let $\D_\rho^{(\epsilon)}$ be as in Proposition~\ref{prop:grid} and let $\hat{c}$ be the optimal solution of~\eq{algos:DAST} with 
\[
\mu=2\sigma \sqrt{ n \log \left(\frac{11 \rho^2}{\delta(1-\rho)} \right)}\,.
\]
Set $\hat{G}(z) = \sum_{w \in \D_{\rho}^{(\epsilon)}} \hat{c}_w \frac{1-|w|^2}{z-w}$.  Then if the set of vectors $\{\cL(\varphi_a)\in \R^n~:~a\in\D_{\rho}^{(\epsilon)}\}$ spans $\R^n$, we have 
\[
\begin{aligned}
	&\|\hat{G}(z)-G_{\star}(z)\|_{\cH_2}^2 \leq  
	186 \frac{1+\rho}{1-\rho} \left( \sqrt{\sigma^2 \log\left(\frac{11 \rho^2}{(1-\rho)\epsilon}\right)}\sqrt{\frac{\|\Gamma_{G_\star}\|_{1}^2}{n(1-\delta)^2} } + \frac{4\|\Gamma_{G_\star}\|_{1}^2}{\pi n(1-\delta)^2}   \right)
	\end{aligned}
\]
with probability $1-e^{-o(n)}$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
To upper bound the $\cH_2$ norm, let us use some properties of functions which admit atomic decompositions.  Note that for any function, $H(z) = \sum_{w \in \D} c_w \varphi_w(z)$ with $\|H\|_{\cA}=\sum_{w\in\D} |c_w|$, we have, for any $z_1,z_2\in\bbS$,
\begin{align}
\nonumber	|H(z_1)|^2-|H(z_2)|^2 &= 
	(|H(z_1)|-|H(z_2)|)(|H(z_1)|+|H(z_2)|) \\
\nonumber	&\leq 2 |H(z_1)-H(z_2)| \|H\|_{\cH_{\infty}} \\
\label{eq:tri-ineq2}	&\leq 2 \left( \sum_{w \in \D} |c_w| |\varphi_w(z_1)-\varphi_w(z_2)|\right) \left(\sum_{w\in \D} |c_w| \|\varphi_w\|_{\cH{\infty}}\right),
\end{align}
where the last inequality is just the triangle inequality. Now, to upper bound the first term in~\eq{tri-ineq2}, we could connect the distance between the poles to the distance between the atoms. Let $z_j = e^{i \theta_j}, j = 1,2$. Then,
\begin{align*}
|\varphi_a(z_1) - \varphi_a(z_2)|
& =   \left|\frac{1-|a|^2}{z_1-a}-\frac{1-|a|^2}{z_2-a}\right|\\
&\leq (1-|a|^2) \left|\frac{z_1-z_2}{(z_1-a)(z_2-a)} \right|\\
&\leq \frac{(1-|a|^2)}{(1-|a|)^2} |z_1-z_2| \leq \frac{1+\rho}{1-\rho} |\theta_1-\theta_2|\,.
\end{align*}
Next, we could upper the $\cH_\infty$ norm~\eq{tri-ineq2} globally. Note that
for any $a \in D$, $\|\varphi_a(z)\|_{\cH_\infty} \leq 2$. In fact, for $z =
\exp(i\theta)$, $|\frac{1-|a|^2}{z-a}| \leq |\frac{1-|a|^2}{1-|a|}| \leq 1+|a|
\leq 2$. Using these computations, we finally have
\begin{align*}
|H(z_1)|^2-|H(z_2)|^2	&\leq 4 \frac{1+\rho}{1-\rho}  \left( \sum_{w \in \D} |c_w|\right)^2 |\theta_1-\theta_2|\\
\nonumber	 &= 4 \frac{1+\rho}{1-\rho}  \|H\|_{\cA}^2 |\theta_1-\theta_2|\,.
\end{align*}

Let $\Delta = G_\star-\hat{G}$ and $\theta_k= \frac{2 \pi k}{n}$. Then we can
bound the norm of $\Delta$ as
\begin{align*}
\|\Delta\|_{\cH_2}^2 &= \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} |\Delta(e^{i\theta})|^2 d\theta\\
&= \frac{1}{2\pi} \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \int_{\theta_k}^{\theta_{k+1}} |\Delta(e^{i\theta})|^2 d\theta\\
&\leq \frac{1}{2\pi} \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \int_{\theta_k}^{\theta_{k+1}} \left(|\Delta(e^{i\theta_k})|^2 + 4 \frac{1+\rho}{1-\rho} \|\Delta\|_{\cA}^2 |\theta-\theta_k| \right)d\theta\\
&= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} |\Delta(e^{i\theta_k})|^2 + \frac{4\pi}{n} \frac{1+\rho}{1-\rho} \|\Delta\|_{\cA}^2\,.
\end{align*}
The inequality here follows from our preceding argument. 

Now, in this expression, we need to both upper bound the size of $\Delta$ on the
measured frequencies and its atomic norm. The following chain of inequalities bounds the latter in terms of the former:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:tri-ineq3}	\|\Delta\|_{\cA} &\leq \| G_\star\|_{\cA}+\|\hat{G}\|_{\cA}\\
\label{eq:Ghat-def}	& = \|G_\star\|_{\cA} + \|\cL(\hat{G})\|_{\cL(\cA_\epsilon)}\\
\label{eq:apply-dast-cond}	& \leq \|G_\star\|_{\cA} + \|\cL(G_\star)\|_{\cL(\cA_\epsilon)} + \mu^{-1} \langle \omega, \cL(\hat{G}-G_{\star})\rangle \\
\label{eq:apply-grid-prop}	& \leq \|G_\star\|_{\cA} + (1-\delta)^{-1}\| \cL(G_\star)\|_{\cL(\cA)} + \mu^{-1} \langle \omega, \cL(\hat{G}-G_{\star})\rangle \\

\end{align}
\eq{tri-ineq3} is the triangle inequality. \eq{Ghat-def} follows from how we defined $\hat{G}$.  \eq{apply-dast-cond} follows from Theorem~\ref{thm:badri}.  \eq{apply-grid-prop} follows from Proposition~\ref{prop:algos:grid}.  \eq{inf-domination} follows because $\|\cL(H)\|_{\cL(\cA)} \leq \|H\|_{\cA}$ for all linear maps $\cL$ and transfer functions $H$.  \eq{holder-mf} is H\"{o}lder's inequality.  Note that the quantity $\|\cL(G_\star)\|_{\cL(\cA_\epsilon)}$ could be infinite if the set $\{\cL(\phi_a)~:~a\in \D_{\rho}^{(\epsilon)}\}$ does not span $\R^n$.  This is precisely what leads to us including this assumption in the theorem statement.

To bound the size of $\Delta$ on the frequency grid, use Theorem~\ref{thm:badri}:
\begin{align*}
	\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} |\Delta(e^{i\theta_k})|^2  &\leq \frac{2\mu}{n} \|\cL(G_\star)\|_{\cL(\cA_\epsilon)}
	\leq \frac{2\mu}{n} (1-\delta)^{-1}\|G_\star\|_{\cA}	\,.
\end{align*}


Let $\omega \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2 I_n)$. Using the well known upper bound for maximum of Gaussian variables (see, for example \cite{lr76}), we have
\begin{align*}
\E[\|\omega\|_{\cL(\cA_\epsilon)}^*] &=	\E\left[ \sup_{a\in\D_\rho^{(\epsilon)}} \langle \cL(\varphi_a), \omega \rangle\right] \leq \sigma \left(\sup_{a\in \D_\rho}\|\cL(\varphi_a)\|_2\right) \sqrt{2 \log |\D_\rho^{(\epsilon)}|}\,.
\end{align*}
Now, $\|\cL(\varphi_a)\|_2 \leq \sqrt{n} \|\varphi_a\|_{\cH_\infty}\leq 2 \sqrt{n}$.  Moreover, by a simple volume argument, $|\D_\rho^{(\epsilon)}| \leq \frac{1024 \rho^4}{\pi^2(1-\rho)^2\delta^2}$.  To see this, suppose $\mathcal{S}$ is a maximal set of points on $\D_\rho$ which are separated by at least $\tau$.  The maximal size of such a set is at most  $\frac{4\rho^2}{\tau^2}$. Moreover, $|\mathcal{S}|\geq |\D_\rho^{(\delta)}|$.  Now set $\tau = \epsilon=\tfrac{\pi (1-\rho) \delta}{16\rho}$.  In particular, note that we have $\E[\|\omega\|^*_{\cL(\cA_\epsilon)}] =\tfrac{1}{2} \mu$.

Now we can put all of the ingredients together.
\begin{align*}
\|\Delta\|_{\cH_2}^2  &\leq \left(1+\frac{8\pi \|\omega\|_2^2}{\mu^2}\frac{1+\rho}{1-\rho} \right)\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} |\Delta(e^{i\theta_k})|^2\\
&\qquad + \frac{16\pi}{n(1-\delta)^2} \frac{1+\rho}{1-\rho}  \|G_\star\|_{\cA}^2\\
&  \leq \left(1+2\pi \frac{1+\rho}{1-\rho} \right) \frac{8\sigma}{1-\delta} \sqrt{\frac{2\log(\frac{1024 \rho^4}{\pi^2(1-\rho)^2\delta^2})}{n}}\|G_\star\|_{\cA} \\
&\qquad+ \frac{16\pi}{n(1-\delta)^2} \frac{1+\rho}{1-\rho}  \|G_\star\|_{\cA}^2\\
&  \leq  59 \frac{1+\rho}{1-\rho} \left( \sqrt{4\sigma^2 \log\left(\frac{11 \rho^2}{(1-\rho)\delta}\right)}\sqrt{\frac{\|G_\star\|_{\cA}^2}{n(1-\delta)^2} } + \frac{\|G_\star\|_{\cA}^2}{n(1-\delta)^2}   \right)
\end{align*}
as desired.

Applying the inequality $\|G_\star\|_{\cA}\leq \tfrac{8}{\pi}\|\Gamma_{G_\star}\|_1$ completes the proof.	
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary} \label{cor:1}
There is a quantity $C$ depending on $\rho$ and $\sigma$ such that for sufficiently large $n$
$$\|\hat{G}(z)-G_{\star}(z)\|_{\cH_2}^2\ \leq C \| \Gamma_{G_{\star}} \|_1 n^{-\frac{1}{2}}$$
with probability exceeding $1-e^{-o(n)}$.
\end{corollary}
\noindent Now, let us look the consequence of the theorem. First of all, the
right hand side is a parameter of the number of samples, the Hankel nuclear norm
of the true system, and the stability radius of the true system. Also, if the
McMillan degree of $G_\star(z)$ is $d$, then we can upper bound the Hankel
nuclear norm by the product of the McMillan degree and the Hankel norm of
$G_\star$: $\|\Gamma_{G_\star}\|_1 \leq d \|\Gamma_{G_\star}\|$. Second, note
that as $n$ tends to infinity, the right hand side tends to zero. In particular,
this means that the discretized algorithm is consistent, and we can quantify the
worst case convergence rate.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

By using the atomic norm framework of~\cite{crpw}, this chapter posits a
reasonable regularizer for linear systems. We looked at a computational method
to handle such a regularizer, and analyzed its statistical performance. Since it
is closely connected to the Hankel nuclear norm but is computationally more
practical, the atomic norm could be useful in a variety of practical
implementations and also in theoretical analysis.

%  However, there are still
% several outstanding questions to address before we fully understand the
% potential of this norm. We list several of these open problems here.


% Although Chapter~\ref{chap:sysid} focused on the single-input
% single-output (SISO) case, we expect that these techniques would
% extend to the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) case. One simple extension to note
% is that if the number of inputs and outputs in the system remain small, the SISO
% techniques presented herein could be applied to each input-output pair.
% Alternative approaches that avoid this pairwise identification would be
% important in large-scale systems with many inputs and outputs, this is an
% important direction for future research.
% 
% To extend our methodology to MIMO systems, we need to find an appropriate set of atoms. One possibility is the set
% \[
% \cA = \left\{ \frac{(1-|w|^2) cb^* }{z-w} ~:~w\in \D, c\in\mathbb{S}^{r-1},\,\,b\in\mathbb{S}^{p-1} \right\}\,,
% \]
% where $p$ is the number of inputs and $r$ is the number of outputs.  Any discrete time, MIMO system with  McMillan degree $d$ can be written in terms of $d$ of these atoms.  The only difficulty remains computing or approximating the norm $\|u\|_{\cL(\cA)}$ for finite measurements as described in Section~\ref{sec:computation}.
